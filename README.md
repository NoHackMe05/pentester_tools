Several directories can also be found which include pre-compiled binaries and files to aid with post-exploitation:

| Path                          | Description                                                            |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/usr/share/linux-binaries`   | Pre-compiled Linux binaries for post-exploitation (such as pspy)       |
| `/usr/share/windows-binaries` | Pre-compiled Windows binaries for post-exploitation (such as Mimikatz) |

## Activate root access via SSH
Make a backup copy of the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Open this file and replace the line: PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin yes

After saving, you must restart the SSH server: service ssh restart

For security, once the script ansible launched, it is necessary to reset the initial configuration.
